# Testing Protocol and Results

## Original User Problem Statement
Build and enhance the "Indii Music" platform for independent artists, following a "Tree Ring System" methodology with Ring 1 (Core Foundation) and Ring 2 (Basic Functionality) already completed. Now implementing Ring 3 (Enhanced Features) and Ring 4 (Advanced Features) focusing on comprehensive upload system with AI integration.

## Testing Protocol
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- After backend testing, ask user permission before testing frontend
- ONLY test frontend if user explicitly requests it
- Always update this file before invoking testing agents
- Never fix something already fixed by testing agents
- Take minimum steps when editing this file

## Communication Protocol with Testing Agents
- Provide clear testing objectives
- Include relevant context about recent changes
- Specify exactly what needs to be tested
- Request specific feedback on functionality

## Testing History
*No testing completed yet - starting Phase 1 implementation*
