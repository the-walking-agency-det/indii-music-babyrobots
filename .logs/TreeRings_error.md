# TreeRings Component Error Log

## Issue Summary
Runtime error: "cannot read properties of undefined"
Component: src/components/3d/TreeRings.jsx
Status: Needs R3F expert review

## Current State
- Component compiles successfully
- Fails at runtime
- UI shows:
  - "Indie music" header
  - Black box with error
  - "Experience the visual rhythm of music" text

## Technical Details
- Syntax errors resolved
- Suspected issues:
  - Undefined ref access in useFrame
  - Potential mesh/geometry lifecycle issues
  - Material property handling
  - Canvas context verification needed

## Action Items for Next Agent
1. Debug undefined property access in runtime
2. Review THREE.RingGeometry implementation
3. Verify meshRefs.current handling
4. Check material property spreading
5. Validate parent Canvas context

## Previous Attempts
- Fixed arrow function syntax error
- Verified successful compilation
- Component still failing at render

## Notes for Next Developer
Focus needed on React Three Fiber specific issues, particularly around mesh refs and Three.js object lifecycle management. Component structure is syntactically valid but failing during execution.
