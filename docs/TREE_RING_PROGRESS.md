## Overview
This document tracks the layered development approach for new feature integration. Each ring must be completed and tested before moving to the next. A feature is only marked as done when all tests pass.

## Collaboration Notes
- All changes must be coordinated through MCP/A2A protocols
- Check for active work before starting any component
- Document all changes in shared context
- Regular commits with clear messages

## Definition of Done
A feature is only considered complete when:
1. All associated tests pass
2. Documentation is updated
3. Code review is completed
4. Performance benchmarks are met
5. Security requirements are satisfied

## Agent Coordination
Current active agents in repository: 5-6
- Coordinate through A2A protocol
- Announce intentions before starting work
- Wait for acknowledgment from other agents
- Regular sync-ups on progress

## Progress Tracking

### Metrics
- 🎯 Features Completed: 0/10
- ✅ Tests Passing: 0/50
- 📊 Code Coverage: 0%
- 🐛 Known Issues: 0
- 🚀 Performance Score: TBD

### Critical Path
1. Complete Ring 1 Assessment (EST: 2 days)
2. Implement Core Data Structures (EST: 3 days)
3. Basic CRUD Operations (EST: 2 days)
4. Component Testing (EST: 2 days)
5. Integration & Fixes (EST: 3 days)
6. Final Testing & Security (EST: 2 days)

### Risk Assessment
- 🔥 High Risk: None identified
- ⚠️ Medium Risk: Performance impact of new features
- ℹ️ Low Risk: UI integration timing

## Rollback Plan
In case of critical issues:
1. Revert to last known good commit
2. Execute `npm run rollback`
3. Notify other agents via A2A protocol
4. Document issue in bug tracker

## Monitoring
- Performance metrics: `/admin/metrics`
- Error logs: `/var/log/app/`
- Test coverage: `/coverage/`
- API documentation: `/docs/api/`

## Daily Updates
(This section will be updated as work progresses)

Latest Update: 2025-07-16 20:10 UTC

### Handoff Status
- Currently working on Ring 1: Core Assessment
- API endpoint documentation in progress (auth.yaml, playlists.yaml, tracks.yaml verified)
- Starting dependency graph generation

### Next Steps for Next Agent
1. Complete dependency graph for:
   - Frontend component dependencies
   - Backend service dependencies
   - Database schema relationships
2. Document remaining API endpoints:
   - metadata_router.py
   - metrics_router.py
   - health_router.py
3. Continue with Ring 2 tasks once Ring 1 is complete

### Critical Notes
- All progress tracked in this markdown file
- Multiple agents active in repository - coordinate via A2A protocol
- Follow tree ring methodology: build from core outward
