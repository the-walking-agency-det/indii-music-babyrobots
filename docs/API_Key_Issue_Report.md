# Project Integration and API Key Issue Report

## Overview

This report outlines the current challenges faced in the indii-music-babyrobots project related to the API key integration with the Moonshot API. This document will serve as a reference for future agents or developers taking over the task.

## Project Components
- **Marketing Agent**
- **AI Router**

## APIs
- **Moonshot API**
- **Gemini API**

## Current Setup
- The project includes a dashboard (index.html) with sidebar navigation for easy access to tools like Marketing Agent, API Testing, Health Check, and music tools.
- The server serves this dashboard at the root path.
- Static file serving and CORS are configured correctly.
- The server is hosted on port 9000.

## Issue Summary
The main issue is persistent 401 Unauthorized errors from the Moonshot API due to incorrect API key usage despite keys being stored and updated in the secure manager.

## Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Secure Secrets Manager Inspection**: Verified placeholders were replaced with real keys, but Moonshot key was still a placeholder initially.
   - **Action**: Updated the Moonshot API key using a Python script.
   - **Result**: Key appeared correctly stored, but the server didn't reload the new key.
2. **Code Review**: Confirmed the Marketing Agent code uses the environment variable for the API key.
   - **Observation**: The server potentially uses the placeholder at runtime instead of the updated key.
3. **Server Restart Attempt**: Tried to restart the server with new keys loaded but was interrupted.
   - **Action**: Ran `node server.js` but it was cancelled, hence no update took place.

## Next Steps
The server must be restarted to ensure it loads the updated API key stored in the environment variable or secure manager.
- **Recommendation**: Restart the server and confirm the API key is taken from the environment.
- **Further Investigation**: Check if any code still literally references "your-actual-api-key".

## Additional Information
After successfully loading fresh keys, if the issue persists, further investigation on network connectivity or API endpoint changes with Moonshot might be necessary.
