# Memory System Test Fixes

## Overview
The test suite for our memory and vector store system is showing several failures that need to be addressed. This document outlines the issues and required fixes.

## Current Test Status

### VectorStore Tests (Configured)
- Basic Operations
  - ⚠️ Store and retrieve documents (needs real DB)
  - ⚠️ Handle multiple documents with semantic search (needs real DB)
- Document Management
  - ⚠️ Delete documents (needs real DB)
  - ⚠️ Update document metadata (needs real DB)
- Search Capabilities
  - ⚠️ Perform semantic search with relevance scores (needs real DB)
  - ⚠️ Respect limit parameter in search (needs real DB)

### TreeRingsMemory Tests (Mixed Results)
- Memory Storage
  - ✅ Store memories with correct ring levels
  - ❌ Link related memories
- Memory Retrieval
  - ✅ Query memories by context
  - ❌ Query memories by time range
  - ❌ Query memories by importance
- ✅ Memory Management
- ✅ Ring Management

## Required Fixes

### 1. Crypto Module Setup
- [x] Configure Vitest to properly recognize Node's crypto module
  - Update Vitest config to include Node built-ins
  - Add proper type definitions
- [x] Implement crypto mock for tests
  - Create consistent UUID generation for tests
  - Place mock in shared test utilities
  - Ensure mock is properly imported in all test files

### 2. PrismaClient Mocking
- [x] Create comprehensive PrismaClient mock
  - Implement all required Prisma operations (findUnique, findMany, etc.)
  - Add proper typing for mock operations
  - Ensure mock maintains test data state correctly
- [x] Update mock setup in test files
  - Add proper mock initialization
  - Ensure mock reset between tests
  - Add cleanup after tests

### 3. Test Data and Assertions
- [ ] Fix time range query tests
  - Review time range calculation logic
  - Verify test data timestamps
  - Update assertions to match expected behavior
- [ ] Fix importance-based query tests
  - Review importance filtering logic
  - Verify test data importance values
  - Update assertions to match expected behavior
- [ ] Fix memory linking tests
  - Implement proper memory linking in mock
  - Verify link data structure
  - Update assertions for linked memories
### 4. Test Infrastructure
- [x] Create shared test utilities
  - TestDatabaseAdapter for real DB testing
  - Test data factories with proper types
  - Common assertions and matchers
- [x] Improve test isolation
  - Database reset between tests
  - Proper connection management
  - Transaction support in Prisma/Supabase
  - Implement proper mock resets

### 5. Code Coverage
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting
  - Configure Vitest coverage collection
  - Set coverage thresholds
  - Add coverage reports to CI

## Implementation Plan

1. Start with crypto module fixes as this affects all VectorStore tests
2. Implement comprehensive PrismaClient mock
3. Fix individual test cases using the improved infrastructure
4. Add test utilities and improve isolation
5. Set up coverage reporting

## Success Criteria

- All tests passing with no warnings
- No TypeScript errors
- Consistent test behavior across multiple runs
- Clear test failure messages
- Adequate test coverage (target: >80%)

## Notes

- Keep mock implementations as close to real implementations as possible
- Maintain type safety throughout
- Document any test-specific behaviors or assumptions
- Consider adding performance benchmarks for critical operations
