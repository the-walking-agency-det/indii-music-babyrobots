**Note from Gemini:** The core UI layout (Shell.tsx) with dynamic user workspaces and agent interaction zone placeholders has been implemented. Dependencies for the frontend (Next.js, Babel presets, Heroicons, class-variance-authority, TailwindCSS PostCSS plugin) have been added and configured. The UI is currently unstyled, awaiting further design integration.
