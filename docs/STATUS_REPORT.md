## In Progress

### Testing
- [ ] Playlist route unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests for playlist API
- [ ] Error case coverage
- [ ] Authentication flow tests

### Documentation Items
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger specifications
- [ ] Full API reference
- [ ] Security documentation
- [ ] Deployment guides

## Next Steps Recommended

1. Complete the test suite for playlist functionality
2. Implement remaining API documentation
3. Add monitoring and observability
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline
5. Implement user analytics
6. Add social features
7. Develop content moderation system

## Technical Debt

1. Need more comprehensive error handling
2. Could improve input validation
3. Should add request/response logging
4. Cache implementation pending

## Security Considerations

1. API rate limiting implemented
2. Authentication middleware in place
3. Ownership validation for playlists
4. Need to implement:
   - Additional input sanitization
   - CORS configuration
   - API key rotation mechanism
   - Audit logging

## Infrastructure Status

- Base API framework operational
- Router system implemented
- Service layer established
- Database integration ready
- Middleware chain functional

## Known Issues

1. Permission system needs refinement
2. Rate limiting needs fine-tuning
3. Error messages need standardization
4. Documentation needs completion

## Recommendations

1. Prioritize test coverage
2. Complete API documentation
3. Implement monitoring
4. Add performance metrics
5. Set up automated deployments
6. Establish backup procedures

This project has a solid foundation and is well-positioned for further development. The architecture is scalable and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and proper error handling.

The documentation roadmap provides a comprehensive guide for future development and maintenance. All core functionality for playlist management is implemented and ready for testing.

Thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this project. Best of luck with its continued development!
