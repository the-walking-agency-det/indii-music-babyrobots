## Growth Tracking ðŸ“ˆ

### Ring Completion Criteria
- Core Ring: All foundation systems operational
- Ring 1: Knowledge and API systems functional
- Ring 2: Specialized agents operational
- Ring 3: Integration layer complete
- Ring 4: Advanced features implemented
- Outer Ring: Production ready

### Current Status
- Active Ring: Core Ring
- Next Ring: Growth Ring 1
- Overall Progress: Foundation Phase

## Implementation Rules ðŸ“‹

1. **Sequential Ring Development**
   - Complete inner rings before outer rings
   - Verify ring stability before moving outward

2. **BBFT Process for Each Component**
   - Build It: Initial implementation
   - Break It: Systematic testing of failure modes
   - Fix It: Address discovered issues
   - Test It: Verify fixes and stability

3. **Ring Transition Requirements**
   - All components in current ring must pass tests
   - Memory system must validate ring completion
   - Documentation must be updated
   - Performance metrics must meet targets

## Next Actions ðŸŽ¯

1. Begin Core Ring implementation:
   - Start with TreeRings memory infrastructure
   - Proceed to core agent protocol
   - Document all foundational decisions

2. Prepare for Growth Ring 1:
   - Design knowledge system architecture
   - Plan API integration strategy
   - Create testing frameworks

*This plan will be updated through the TreeRings system as implementation progresses.*
