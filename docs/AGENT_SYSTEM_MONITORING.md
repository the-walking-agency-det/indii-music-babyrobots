## 🛡️ Security Monitoring

### Current Security Issues
1. **Mock Implementations**
   - ⚠️ Weak crypto implementation in mocks
   - ⚠️ Basic WebSocket security
   - ⚠️ Missing rate limiting implementation

2. **API Security**
   - ⚠️ Cache implementation needs TTL
   - ⚠️ API auth token handling review needed
   - ⚠️ Missing input validation in API calls

3. **Agent Communication**
   - ⚠️ Message authentication needed
   - ⚠️ Agent authorization system incomplete
   - ⚠️ Secure channel establishment required

### Required Security Improvements
- [ ] Implement proper crypto for production
- [ ] Add WebSocket security layer
- [ ] Complete rate limiting system
- [ ] Add message signing/verification
- [ ] Implement proper auth token management
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Complete cache security measures

## 🔄 Changes Log

### 2025-07-17 15:55
- Initial system scaffold complete
- Basic mock infrastructure in place
- Core agent architecture implemented

## 📝 Notes
1. Vector store needs production implementation
2. Knowledge base is currently a placeholder
3. Security hardening needed across system
4. Test coverage required for all components

## 🎯 Next Steps
1. Monitor for vector store implementation
2. Watch for knowledge base completion
3. Track security improvements
4. Document test coverage as it's added
