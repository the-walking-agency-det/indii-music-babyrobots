# Debug Report: `src/main.js` `ReferenceError: VectorStore is not defined`

## Problem Description

The `src/main.js` script is encountering a `ReferenceError: VectorStore is not defined` when the `initializeAgents()` function is called from within the `simulatePerformanceExperiment()` function.

This error indicates that `VectorStore` (and potentially other shared component instances like `APIManager`, `MemoryMapper`, `RAGSystem`, etc.) is not accessible or properly defined within the scope where `initializeAgents()` is being executed during the performance simulation.

## Analysis of Root Cause

The core issue appears to be a persistent problem with variable scoping and dependency injection in JavaScript modules, specifically when `initializeAgents()` is called indirectly.

Initially, `initializeAgents()` was designed to accept parameters for shared components. However, when `simulatePerformanceExperiment()` calls `initializeAgents()`, the parameters were either not being passed correctly or the `initializeAgents` function itself was not correctly structured to receive and utilize them in a way that maintained their scope.

My attempts to fix this have led to a loop, suggesting a deeper misunderstanding or a more complex interaction of module loading and execution order.

## Attempts to Resolve

1.  **Explicitly Passing Dependencies:**
    *   **Action:** Modified `initializeAgents()` to accept `vectorStore`, `rateLimiter`, `apiCache`, `apiManager`, `interAgentAPI`, `mcpProtocol`, `knowledgeBase`, and `ragSystem` as direct parameters.
    *   **Action:** Updated the call to `initializeAgents()` within `simulatePerformanceExperiment()` to pass these instances.
    *   **Outcome:** The `ReferenceError` persisted, indicating that even with explicit passing, the `initializeAgents` function was not correctly recognizing or utilizing these parameters, or there was an underlying issue with how these instances were being created or re-created.

2.  **Restructuring `initializeAgents` for Self-Containment:**
    *   **Action:** Moved the initialization of all shared components (e.g., `const vectorStore = new VectorStore();`) from `runAllDemonstrations()` into the `initializeAgents()` function itself.
    *   **Action:** Removed the parameters from the `initializeAgents()` function signature, making it a self-contained unit responsible for its own component initialization.
    *   **Action:** Updated the call to `initializeAgents()` within `simulatePerformanceExperiment()` to simply `await initializeAgents();`.
    *   **Outcome:** The `ReferenceError` still occurred. This suggests that even when `initializeAgents` attempts to create its own instances, there might be an issue with the `import` statements or the environment's module resolution that prevents `VectorStore` (and others) from being properly defined at the point of instantiation within the `initializeAgents` function when called from `simulatePerformanceExperiment`.

## Current Status

I am currently stuck in a loop trying to resolve this `ReferenceError`. Despite attempts to manage dependency injection and variable scope, the error persists. This indicates a need for a fresh perspective and a deeper dive into the JavaScript module system and execution context within this specific environment.

## Next Steps (Recommended)

Given the current impasse, it is advisable to:
*   **Review the entire module loading and execution flow** in `src/main.js` and its imported dependencies.
*   **Consider simplifying the module structure** further if possible, or isolating the problematic `initializeAgents` call in a minimal reproducible example.
*   **Verify the Node.js version and module resolution settings** to ensure they are not contributing to unexpected behavior.
*   **Potentially introduce more granular logging** within the constructors and initialization steps of `VectorStore` and other components to trace their lifecycle.
