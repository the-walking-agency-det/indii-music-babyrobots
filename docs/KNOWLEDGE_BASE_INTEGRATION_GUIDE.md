## ðŸ¤– **Integration with Your Existing AI Agents**

### INDII Agent Integration
Your existing INDII agent (defined in `.ai_rules/agents/indii_agent.md`) can now access industry-specific knowledge:

```javascript
// In your AI agent code
const knowledgeResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:9000/api/knowledge/music-industry', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: userQuery,
    agent_id: 'indii_agent',
    context: {
      artist_stage: userProfile.stage || 'emerging',
      genre: userProfile.genre
    }
  })
});

const knowledge = await knowledgeResponse.json();

// Use the structured response in your AI prompt
const aiPrompt = `
${knowledge.ai_instruction.role}

Context: ${knowledge.ai_instruction.tone}
Focus: ${knowledge.ai_instruction.focus}

Relevant Knowledge:
- Stage: ${knowledge.knowledge_response.relevant_knowledge.current_stage.description}
- Priorities: ${knowledge.knowledge_response.relevant_knowledge.current_stage.advice.priorities.join(', ')}
- Budget Guidance: ${JSON.stringify(knowledge.knowledge_response.practical_advice.budget_guidance)}

User Question: ${userQuery}

Provide mentoring advice based on the above knowledge.
`;
```

### Marketing Agent Integration
For your marketing agent:

```javascript
const marketingKnowledge = await fetch('http://localhost:9000/api/knowledge/music-industry', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "What's the best promotion strategy for this campaign?",
    agent_id: 'marketing_agent',
    context: {
      campaign_type: 'release_campaign',
      artist_stage: 'developing'
    }
  })
});
```

## ðŸ”„ **Integration Patterns**

### Pattern 1: Knowledge-Enhanced Responses
```javascript
// Before responding to user, get relevant knowledge
const knowledge = await getKnowledgeForQuery(userQuery, agentId, userContext);

// Enhance your AI prompt with this knowledge
const enhancedPrompt = buildPromptWithKnowledge(userQuery, knowledge);

// Generate response using your preferred AI model
const response = await generateAIResponse(enhancedPrompt);
```

### Pattern 2: Context-Aware Advice
```javascript
// Determine user's artist development stage
const artistStage = determineArtistStage(userProfile);

// Get stage-specific knowledge
const stageKnowledge = await getKnowledgeForAgent('indii_agent', query, {
  artist_stage: artistStage
});

// Provide advice tailored to their career stage
```

### Pattern 3: Search-Driven Support
```javascript
// For open-ended questions, search the knowledge base
const searchResults = await searchKnowledgeBase(userQuery);

// Use search results to provide comprehensive answers
const contextualResponse = buildResponseFromSearchResults(searchResults);
```
