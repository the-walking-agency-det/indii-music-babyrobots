# Tech Stack Migration Strategy & Baseline Analysis

## Current State Analysis (CORE Phase Complete)

### Technology Stack Assessment

#### ‚úÖ Current Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js (with React 19 already implemented!)
- **Database**: better-sqlite3 with comprehensive schema
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with extensive custom configuration
- **State Management**: Basic React state (no global state management)
- **Testing**: Jest with React Testing Library (extensive test suite)
- **Build Tools**: Next.js built-in tooling

#### ‚úÖ Baseline Test Results
```
Test Results Summary:
- Total Tests: ~20 test suites
- Passing: 12 test suites ‚úÖ
- Failing: 8 test suites ‚ùå
- Main Issues:
  - Schema mismatches between test DB and production DB
  - Missing node-mocks-http dependency
  - Foreign key constraint failures in profile tests
  - Mock function setup issues
```

#### ‚úÖ Database Schema Analysis
The system has a well-designed database with:
- **User Management**: Complete with profile types
- **Profile System**: All 4 profile types (artist, fan, licensor, service_provider)
- **Content Management**: Tracks, audio files, workspaces
- **Social Features**: Chat sessions, tasks, split sheets
- **Comprehensive Relationships**: Proper foreign keys and cascading

### Migration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Database Migration (Supabase + Prisma)
**Goal**: Migrate from better-sqlite3 to Supabase + Prisma while maintaining 100% API compatibility

**Steps**:
1. Set up Supabase project
2. Create Prisma schema matching current structure
3. Implement dual-database support for testing
4. Migrate data and switch connections
5. Remove SQLite dependencies

**Risk Level**: Medium (well-tested current system provides good baseline)

#### Phase 2: State Management Enhancement
**Goal**: Implement Zustand + TanStack Query for better state management

**Steps**:
1. Install Zustand and TanStack Query
2. Create stores for user profiles, tracks, tasks
3. Implement API client with React Query
4. Migrate existing components incrementally
5. Add optimistic updates and caching

**Risk Level**: Low (additive changes, can be implemented gradually)

#### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure Expansion
**Goal**: Comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright + enhanced unit testing

**Steps**:
1. Set up Playwright for E2E testing
2. Create user journey tests for all profile types
3. Fix existing test issues and improve coverage
4. Add accessibility testing
5. Implement visual regression testing

**Risk Level**: Low (improves quality, doesn't break existing functionality)

#### Phase 4: Performance & Monitoring
**Goal**: Add comprehensive monitoring and performance optimization

**Steps**:
1. Set up Vercel Analytics and Sentry
2. Implement performance budgets
3. Add custom metrics and alerting
4. Optimize Core Web Vitals
5. Create performance testing suite

**Risk Level**: Very Low (purely additive)

### Key Insights from Current Analysis

#### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Modern Foundation**: Already using React 19 and Next.js
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test coverage (once fixed)
3. **Well-Designed Schema**: Solid database architecture
4. **Good UI System**: Tailwind with custom design system

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Improvement
1. **Test Quality**: Several broken tests need fixing
2. **State Management**: No global state management
3. **Database Layer**: SQLite limits scalability
4. **Monitoring**: No performance or error tracking
5. **Type Safety**: Limited TypeScript usage

### Next Steps

#### Immediate Actions (Starting RING 1)
1. ‚úÖ Baseline analysis complete
2. üü° Set up Supabase project
3. üü° Install Prisma and create schema
4. üü° Implement database migration scripts
5. üü° Fix existing test issues

#### Success Criteria for RING 1
- [ ] Supabase connection established
- [ ] Prisma schema matches current structure exactly
- [ ] All existing tests pass with new database
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to API
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

### Risk Mitigation

#### Backup Strategy
- Full database backup before migration
- Git branch for each major change
- Ability to rollback to SQLite if needed

#### Testing Strategy
- Run old and new database side-by-side during transition
- Comprehensive integration testing
- User acceptance testing for all workflows

#### Monitoring Strategy
- Track performance metrics during migration
- Monitor error rates and user experience
- Set up alerts for any degradation
