# Universal Context Reinforcer System: The Simple Guide

Hey there! Welcome to the Universal Context Reinforcer System (UCRS). This is a quick, no-fluff guide to get you started. Our inside joke is that this is the ‚ÄòFor Dummies‚Äô guide to our code, so let‚Äôs get to it!

## What is this thing?

Think of the UCRS as a smart notebook that all of your projects share. When you learn something new in one project, you can teach it to the `UCRS`, and then all your other projects automatically get that knowledge if they need it.

**In short: Solve a problem once, and the solution is there for you everywhere.**

## How to Get Started (in 3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Set up a new project

First, you need to tell the `UCRS` about your project. Open your terminal, go to your project's folder, and run this command:

```bash
python3 /path/to/universal_context_reinforcer_system/run_reinforcer.py setup .
```

The system will ask you if its guess about your project is correct. Just answer `Y` or `n`.

### Step 2: Teach the System Something New

Let's say you just figured out a tricky bug. You can add that solution to the shared knowledge. In our inside joke, this is like telling the system, ‚ÄúHey, remember this!‚Äù

To do this, you‚Äôll use the `capture_knowledge.py` script. Here‚Äôs how you‚Äôd add a note about a Python error:

```python
from universal_context_reinforcer_system.capture_knowledge import capture

capture(
    title="Fix for Python Import Errors",
    content="The problem was a wrong virtual environment. Use `python -m pip install` to fix.",
    languages=["python"]
)
```

### Step 3: Sync a Project with the Shared Knowledge

Now, for the magic. Go into any of your other projects and run this command to get all the latest knowledge:

```bash
python3 /path/to/universal_context_reinforcer_system/run_reinforcer.py sync . .
```

## Cool Trick: The `--dry-run`

If you want to see what the `sync` command *would* do without actually changing any files, just add `--dry-run` at the end. It‚Äôs like asking, ‚ÄúWhat would happen if I did this?‚Äù without any of the commitment.

```bash
python3 /path/to/universal_context_reinforcer_system/run_reinforcer.py sync . . --dry-run
```

That‚Äôs it! You‚Äôre now using the Universal Context Reinforcer System. Happy coding!
