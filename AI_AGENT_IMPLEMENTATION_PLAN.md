  - *Reason: Enables structured inter-agent communication*
- [ ] Create task delegation system
  - *Reason: Manages work distribution between agents*
- [ ] Build conflict resolution system
  - *Reason: Handles competing agent priorities*

## 6. Training and Fine-tuning üìö
### Priority: HIGH
- [ ] Create agent-specific training datasets
  - *Reason: Improves specialized knowledge and responses*
- [ ] Implement continuous learning system
  - *Reason: Allows agents to improve from interactions*
- [ ] Build performance monitoring
  - *Reason: Tracks and improves agent effectiveness*

## 7. Security and Compliance üîí
### Priority: HIGH
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
  - *Reason: Ensures appropriate agent permissions*
- [ ] Create audit logging system
  - *Reason: Tracks all agent actions for accountability*
- [ ] Build privacy protection system
  - *Reason: Safeguards sensitive artist information*

## 8. Testing and Validation üß™
### Priority: MEDIUM
- [ ] Create automated testing suite
  - *Reason: Ensures consistent agent performance*
- [ ] Implement scenario simulations
  - *Reason: Tests agents in various situations*
- [ ] Build performance benchmarking
  - *Reason: Measures and maintains agent efficiency*

## 9. User Interface Integration üñ•Ô∏è
### Priority: MEDIUM
- [ ] Create agent interaction components
  - *Reason: Provides user interface for agent communication*
- [ ] Implement response visualization
  - *Reason: Makes agent outputs more understandable*
- [ ] Build feedback collection system
  - *Reason: Gathers user input for improvement*

## 10. Deployment and Scaling üöÄ
### Priority: LOW
- [ ] Create containerization setup
  - *Reason: Enables easy deployment and scaling*
- [ ] Implement load balancing
  - *Reason: Handles multiple concurrent users*
- [ ] Build monitoring and alerting
  - *Reason: Maintains system health*

## Success Metrics üìä
