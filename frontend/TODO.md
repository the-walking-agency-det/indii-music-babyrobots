## Methodology
- Follow “make it, break it, fix it, test it” methodology for robust development:
  - **Make**: Develop features as planned with initial tests.
  - **Break**: Identify and test edge cases or failure points.
  - **Fix**: Resolve discovered issues and iterate on the solution.
  - **Test**: Validate the solutions with comprehensive tests.

## Timeline
- **Start Date**: 2025-07-16
- **Target Completion**: 2025-07-30
- **Review Dates**: Weekly on Wednesdays

## Progress Tracking
- Complete documentation and integration testing after coding and UI revisions.
- Maintain test coverage minimums and aim for testing 100% of functionality.

*Remember*, efficiency in coding stems from a clear, well-organized approach coupled with iterative testing.
