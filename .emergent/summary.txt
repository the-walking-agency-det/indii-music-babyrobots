The AI engineer's initial phase involved trying to locate expected files, like , which were absent, leading to initial exploration of the  directory. This revealed two distinct projects: a basic React application and a more complex Indii Music Next.js project. Initially, the AI addressed the React app's dependencies and configuration. However, the user explicitly redirected focus to the Indii Music project ( on ). Embracing the user's Make it, break it, fix it, test it and Tree Ring System methodologies, the AI successfully completed Ring 1 by fixing critical database import issues within profile APIs and verifying core database functionality. Ring 2 was then completed by expanding profile API functionality to all user types, creating corresponding frontend pages, and integrating them into the main navigation. The current state is a well-structured Next.js application with robust profile management, and the AI is now planning for a comprehensive general upload system for Ring 3 and Ring 4.

<product_requirements>
The core objective is to develop and enhance the Indii Music platform, envisioned as a sophisticated music industry application. The development follows a Tree Ring System methodology, prioritizing foundational elements (Ring 1) before progressively adding basic (Ring 2), enhanced (Ring 3), and advanced (Ring 4) features.
The application currently functions as a Next.js 14 + React 18 + Tailwind CSS frontend, leveraging a SQLite database for data management. It incorporates JWT-based authentication with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
Explicit user requests and implemented features include:
1.  **Project Focus Shift:** Transitioned from a generic React app to the specific Indii Music project located at , running on .
2.  **Ring 1: Core Foundation:** Ensured backend API stability by fixing database import errors in profile endpoints, confirming database connectivity, and enabling test user creation and full CRUD operations for Artist profiles.
3.  **Ring 2: Basic Functionality:** Expanded the profile management system to support all four user types (Artist, Fan, Licensor, Service Provider) by creating respective API endpoints, basic profile display pages, and integrated profile forms accessible via the homepage.
4.  **Future Enhancements (Rings 3 & 4):** A comprehensive general upload system is required, capable of handling diverse file formats (images, audio, documents) and potentially integrating with external cloud storage services like Google Drive.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** Next.js (Frontend & API routes), Node.js, SQLite (Database).
-   **Frontend:** React 18, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Database:** SQLite, managed via custom  helper.
-   **Methodologies:** Tree Ring System (phased development), Make it, break it, fix it, test it (iterative problem-solving).
-   **Authentication:** JWT with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control).

<code_architecture>
The application primarily exists within the  directory, following a Next.js project structure with integrated API routes.



-   : Manages project dependencies and defines development scripts, notably  for running the Next.js application.
-   : This is a crucial file containing the SQLite database connection logic and an extensive set of functions for interacting with the database, including user and profile CRUD operations. It defines the database schema and is central to data persistence.
-   : The root page of the Next.js application, serving as the landing page and now including navigation links to the newly created profile-related pages.
-   : A custom Next.js App component, created to properly initialize pages, encapsulate global styles, and provide context providers (e.g., AuthContext) across the entire application.
-   : A simple API endpoint developed for health checking the backend, returning a status message.
-    (artist.js, fan.js, licensor.js, service-provider.js): These files define the RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting the four distinct user profile types. The AI engineer fixed critical database import issues within these files.
-   : A temporary utility API endpoint used to facilitate the creation of test user accounts for development and testing purposes.
-   : A newly created frontend page designed to display user profiles, likely fetching data from the profile API endpoints.
-   : A new frontend page intended to host the forms for creating or editing user profiles, interacting with the respective API endpoints.
-   ,  (and implied others): Existing React components for profile input forms, which will be connected to the new APIs.
-   : A markdown file generated by the AI detailing the compartmentalized tasks for future development related to user profile enhancement and music upload.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Ring 3: Enhanced Features:** Implement profile image upload, connect remaining profile forms to APIs, add role switching functionality, and create profile completion tracking.
-   **Ring 4: Advanced Features:** Establish the core audio upload foundation, integrate a simple audio player, handle basic track metadata, and develop a track listing page.
-   **General Upload System:** Design and implement a versatile system for uploading various file types (images, documents, audio) with potential integration with external storage services like Google Drive.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had successfully completed the Ring 1: Core Foundation and Ring 2: Basic Functionality phases of the Indii Music project located at . The project is fully operational and accessible at .

**Current State & Nuances:**
The application now boasts a robust backend for user profiles and a basic frontend structure for managing them. Specifically:
-   **Core APIs are functional:** The API endpoints for Artist, Fan, Licensor, and Service Provider profiles () have been created, and their critical database import issues in  were identified and fixed, ensuring proper interaction with the SQLite database.
-   **Test Users and CRUD:** The system can create test users via a temporary  endpoint. Full CRUD operations for Artist profiles and basic creation for all other profile types have been successfully tested and validated.
-   **Frontend Accessibility:** Essential Next.js structural files (, ) were created or modified. The main  now includes navigation to the newly developed  (for viewing profiles) and  (for creating/editing profiles), making the profile management accessible from the main application.
-   **Roadmap Generation:** A detailed  file has been created, outlining the next steps for User Profile Enhancement (Priority 2) and Music Upload System (Priority 3).

The work has laid a solid foundation for the Indii Music platform's core user management capabilities, moving from isolated components to an integrated, functional system ready for further feature development as outlined in the Tree Ring methodology.
